# CREST Prompt System: The Bisection Pipeline

## Temporal Diptych Architecture

Each ROOT video is a **Dual-Liturgy** designed to be split:

| Half | Time | Liturgy | Visual Logic |
|------|------|---------|--------------|
| **A** | 0:00-0:07 | ENTRY+CHANT | Ochre/Marble/Fire |
| **B** | 0:07-0:14 | TURN+SEAL | Gray/Plastic/Wire |

## Scene Prompt Template

```
ACT AS: Lead Visual Architect for CREST Research Interface

SCENE: [C1-C9]
MOTIF NODE: [A_EXPECTATION | A_MULTITUDE | A_SILENCE | A_VIOLENCE | A_BETRAYAL | A_FORGE]

CEREMONY BUFFER:
- ENTRY: [Visual anchor]
- CHANT: [Mass-produced texture]
- TURN: [Glitch/transition through portal]
- SEAL: [Leaden finality]

STYLE: Hyper-Staged. No naturalism.
The "shining metal" reflects both gold (stage) and gray (wasteland).

TECHNICAL: 24fps, 16:9, locked-tripod for seamless split-parsing.

## Missing Scene Prompts

| Scene | ROOT Prompt |
|-------|-------------|
| C5/C6 | "Dark stage, three vertical beams. Stark spotlight. Silent audience in shadows." |
| C8 | "Single spotlight on dead plastic grass. Boy casting long sharp shadow." |
| C9 | "Armorer as technician at forge-terminal. Contrast: flesh/warmth vs cold metal." |
